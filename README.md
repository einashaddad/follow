follow
======

A script that scrapes the Hacker School website for student's GitHub handles, then makes API calls to follow Hacker Schoolers in your batch on GitHub.

To run :

    python follow.py


**NOTE:**
Scraping of the Hacker School website was necessary in order to retrieve all the GitHub handles. The Hacker School API would not suffice because that returns credentials of the specific person logged in and not all students.
